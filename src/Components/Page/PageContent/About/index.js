            <p className="about-me">I'm a Software Engineer with a certificate in Full Stack Web Development and pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
            I leverage my customer service and logistics background to bridge the gap between backend and an intuitive user interface. I'm known by my peers as
            being an essential member to the team and I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a programmer. 
            </p>
            <p className="about-me">
            As a natural leader, I've helmed project planning and kept communication open and ongoing between team members on multiple projects such of Pick of the Day and We Rate Pets.
            I feel the best way to work together and get things done is to keep communication flowing, provide updates, and see where I can apply
            myself to assist others.
